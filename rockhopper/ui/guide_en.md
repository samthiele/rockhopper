## Guide
- Tell us something cool about your dataset.
- Include general information first.
- Then describe detailed stops.

The text in this section can be relatively long and detailed, and contain pictures or other markdown-compatable formatting. A useful guide to writing markdown files can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

Note that the hash part of the URL can be used to link to specific headings (defined using # or ##) in this markdown file. You can see this in action by clicking [here](/#site2) or [here](/#guide). If these sites area also registered
in the `index.json` file, then corresponding changes in the viewer (camera position, render style, point visibility etc.) will be updated and any defined site audio triggered. Note that these links are possibly language specific!

It's generally assumed that each "stop" associated with each part of a virtual field trip will contain a corresponding heading.

## [Site 1](/#site1)
- How cool is this place! Look what we can see?
- I found a nice rock - check it out!

## [Site 2](/#site2)

- This is another location that we want to explore in this dataset.
- Clicking on the link above will zoom directly too it in the dataset, so we can 
  explore ourselves and see what is going on.
