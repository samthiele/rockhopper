## Further reading

For many tours, it's a good idea to include a "References" tab that acts like a bibliography and acknowledges the data sources. This is thus included by default (though can be removed by editing the `tabs` field in the `index.json` file).

## Data attribution

The beautiful photosphere comes from the South Pole observatory in Antarctica. Cold, but no rock-hopper penguins unfortunately.

(having a look at the original high-resolution version of this photosphere is highly reccomended).

The 3D Rock Hopper penguin is from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rockhopper-penguin-a3866027d797445c9188cd4e05798320).
