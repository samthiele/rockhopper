# Welcome to RockHopper

The following sections outline how *rockhopper* can be used to build engaging and narrative rich virtual field trips (VFTs). While this demo is hosted on the main *rockhopper* [GitHub page](https://samthiele.github.io/rockhopper/demo_tour/index.html#/start), it is better to follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/samthiele/rockhopper/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb) to run the VFT in "development mode" (using a local web-server).

Have an explore to learn about the different VFT tools you can use.

![Don't forget to be engaging and interactive, or the audience will fall asleep.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/ZSL_London_-_Northern_rockhopper_penguin_%2801%29.jpg)



### About Markdown

Markdown files are used to store the rich-text content in RockHopper tours. You can edit these using any text editor (e.g., see [here](https://github.com/samthiele/rockhopper/blob/main/public/demo_tour/md/about_en.md) to see the raw file). Or, better still, if you run a tour locally using a development server then the files will be editable in the web-browser:
 - `double-click` a tab to see and edit the corresponding markdown
 - then press `Shift+Enter` to update the underlying file and render it
