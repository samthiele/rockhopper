## Notebook

This markdown tab remains editable even when a VFT is no longer in development mode (running on a local server). 

You can thus use it now to e.g., try out different markdown elements. Double click to edit and enter your thoughts (in markdown). Use `shift+enter` to finish editing.

During VFTs for teaching, students might use this tab to:

- Jot down notes and observations, just like a real fieldtrip!
- Document observations and findings.
- Answer questions or assignments.

Double click to edit and enter your thoughts (in markdown). Use `shift+enter` to finish editing.

## Saving notes

It is important to remember that changes made here will not be saved (outside of development mode). 

Instead, the `Notes ⬇` and `⬆` buttons below can be used to save or upload this notebook as a markdown file!

## Annotation tables

Any annotations[^1] you take will also appear in tables here. For example, if you create some planes, the strike and dip of these planes will appear in the table below. This can be used to take structural measurements (of lineations or foliations) during a VFT.

As with the notes markdown, these annotations will not be saved on refreshing the site when outside of development mode. However, `json` files containing all the created annotations can be downloaded or uploaded using the `Annotations ⬇` and `⬆` buttons in the lower left of the 3D view.

[^1]: Use `shift+left-click` to add annotation points. Two points define a line (trend, plunge and distance) while three define a plane (strike, dip, dipdir). More than this defines a polyline. Once finished, use `Enter` to save the annotation and add it to the table (or `Esc` to cancel). See the `Help` tab for further details.
