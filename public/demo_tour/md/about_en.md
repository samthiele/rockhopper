This is a squeaky clean markdown file. `Double-click` it (when running a local
development server) to edit it's contents and explain this part of your tour. Once
ready, press `Shift+Enter` to update and save changes. 

A useful guide to writing markdown files can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

**N.B. Please translate this file according to the corresponding language suffix**

## Fancy markdown

Markdown text can be long and detailed, and translated into several languages (see buttons on the bottom left). It can also contain various media, including pictures.
